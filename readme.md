# Go Pague PHP Library

## Requirements

PHP 7.0.1 and later.

## Composer

You can install the bindings via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command:

```bash
composer require go-pague/go-pague-php
```

To use the go pague classes, use Composer's [autoload](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#autoloading):

```php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
```

## Dependencies

This library require the following extension in order to work properly:

- [`curl`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php), although you can use your own non-cURL client if you prefer
- [`json`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.json.php)
- [`mbstring`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php) (Multibyte String)

If you use Composer, these dependencies should be handled automatically. If you install manually, you'll want to make sure that these extensions are available.

## Getting Started

@todo

## Development

Install dependencies:

``` bash
composer install
```

## Tests

Install dependencies as mentioned above (which will resolve [PHPUnit](http://packagist.org/packages/phpunit/phpunit)), then you can run the test suite:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Or to run an individual test file:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/SomeTest.php
```
